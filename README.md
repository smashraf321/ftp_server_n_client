# ftp_server_n_client
My implementation of a File Transfer Protocol in Linux

Finally completed the project. Will put up how to use in detail later.
In brief, run the server and client as follows:
Server -
./ftpServer <IP address of server>
eg: 
./ftpServer 127.0.0.1
Client -
./ftpClient <IP address of client>:14085
eg:
./ftpClient localhost:14085
